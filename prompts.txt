Refine Web Sockets Part:

1. Omit learning objectives. Shorted Web Socket vs HTTP and its significance to at max 50 words.

2. Indexing regarding headings and sub headings has wrong numbering.

3. Ensure that like real world apps, the documentations clearly explains: the setup of users choosing which user to talk to, creating groups and choosing which group to talk to instead of assuming a universal group, or that a particular group already exists. That part can be added as comment. E.g., on UI user click on a group card, that triggerd the join_group function and that groups unique ID stored in DB schema was sent... something like this in comments. Well written comments.

4. Refine ASCII arts a little more.

5. Use comments more in handler snippets to revise/recall where a particular object or value that we are using came from to help user keep track.

6. Combine Handler Code Implementation with its general pattern part. You can write basic function call syntax or keywords using comments.
